obstacle_range: 0.5
# obstancle_range is 0.5 meters, which means that the robot will only update its map with information about obstacles that are within 0.5 meters of the base
raytrace_range: 1.0
# raytrace_range is 1.0 meters, which means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to 1.0 meters away given a sensor reading.
#footprint: [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ... [xn, yn]]
robot_radius: 0.10 
# kamu_robotu has 10 cm outer radius

inflation_radius: 0.25
# setting the inflation radius at 0.25 meters means that the robot will treat all paths that stay 0.25 meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost
observation_sources: OKO_LIDAR

OKO_LIDAR: {sensor_frame: base_scan, data_type: LaserScan, topic: scan, marking: true, clearing: true}
# OKO_LIDAR publishes into /scan topic with frame name: base_scan
# base_scan is the tf frame that contains LIDAR
# The "marking" and "clearing" parameters determine whether the sensor will be used to add obstacle information to the costmap, clear obstacle information from the costmap, or do both.
